Module 14 Challenge

Acknowledgements: Ahmad Sweed for going through module 14 activities days 1, 2, 3 and after class during office hours to go through questions.

Figured out how to publish to Github pages prior using existing class resources, github, and stackflow.

Attempted to look at creating a gauge, however, did not have time to complete based on the time I had set aside and focused on the next project.
